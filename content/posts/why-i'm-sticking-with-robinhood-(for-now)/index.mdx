**TL;DR** I don't think Robinhood deserves the hate they're getting for the unfortunate conclusion to the GameStop saga, and until a better option is available, I will be sticking with them.

It's been a little over a week since the height of the GameStop short squeeze craze, and I have some thoughts about Robinhood's involvement in suppressing the momentum behind the movement, consequently leading to many angry investors.  The backlash they've gotten is immense, and it seems that I'm in the minority for being forgiving and sticking with them.

The restrictions that several brokerages had to impose undoubtedly manipulated the price in favor of those shorting the stock.  Robinhood is the notable offender because its platform consists mostly of retail investors, presumably many of whom were buying GameStop.  It does appear like Robinhood betrayed its customers and its mission of democratizing access to financial markets.

In that sense, I completely understand the anger and disappointment.  I was in the trade myself, and I will admit that just as it felt like we were winning, the system failed us.  I always try to assess risks to the best of my ability, but I certainly did not consider outright restrictions on buying individual stocks.

With that said, I also empathize with Robinhood because they're still a relatively new company with a lot less capital than some of their more mature competitors, like Fidelity and Vanguard.  I think they genuinely did not expect the kinds of volatility and concentration around the small subset of stocks we saw last week.  Due to financial and operational constraints, they likely had little choice but to implement temporary hotfixes, like position-closing only and limited buying restrictions.  Ironically, their success almost broke them.

Their most critical mistakes, in my opinion, were communication and some of their decision-making, like hiding the restricted stocks from being searched and viewed.  I'm also not a fan of the narrative about retail investors needing protection and being uneducated about investing.  As a customer, these are things I expect them to improve upon going forward.

To be clear, I am not tied to Robinhood indefinitely, and I regularly evaluate other options, even as recent as a few days ago.  My decision to continue using them comes down to how I invest and what I value in a brokerage platform.  As important as reliability is to me, I currently place more value in a mobile-first experience, efficiency, and the user interface.

I am optimistic that Robinhood will become more reliable as they scale, and I am willing to face the growing pains with them.  If you agree and don't already have an account, sign up with my [referral code](https://join.robinhood.com/jasonk687) to get a free stock ðŸ’°.
