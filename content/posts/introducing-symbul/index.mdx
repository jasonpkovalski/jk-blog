My childhood friend Kevin and I currently work as software engineers at the same company and team.  He is primarily a front-end engineer, while I have focused on infrastructure and back-end development, so we cover the full software stack between the two of us.  We thought it would be fun to work on a side project together.

After considering several ideas, we ultimately decided to build our take on a stock screener as a web application.  Compared to some of the other screeners out there, we think Symbul is different for its simplicity, accessibility, and iterative workflow.

It works best on a desktop browser, but we tried our best to make it responsive, so it should work well on mobile devices too!

Filters are stackable, and each new filter that's applied will automatically adjust the remaining filter options so that users can continue narrowing the search space without hitting dead ends.  For example, if the finance and insurance sector is selected, the industry filter will only include industries that belong to that sector, like commercial banking, investment advice, etc.  Similarly, if the market capitalization in the current grid ranges between $500 million and $1 billion, the market capitalization filter will exclude options outside of that range.  The [How-To](https://symbul.app/how-to) page has more information on how the filtering works, as well as some general tips.

What we have out there now is what we consider to be the minimum viable product.  We already have some ideas for additional features, like stock profile pages and filterable watchlists.  We are also open to suggestions and constructive criticism, so feel free to send us an email at symbul.app@gmail.com.  You can also contact me via any of my social media accounts.  Finally, there are monthly expenses that we pay out of pocket to keep the application up and running, so any donations are much appreciated!
